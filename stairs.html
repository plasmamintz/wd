  <p>you decide to continue down the hallway, treading further into the depths of the manor.
  as you near the end of the hallway, you notice a tall, metal staircase spiraling up to an upper floor.
  you start towards it, but its then that a quiet murmur catches your attention. you look to your right,
  and you hear what sounds like a soft whisper echoing from a nearby room. <br><br>

  help you...</p>
