  <p>you pick up the dog's baseball and chuck it as far down that hallway as possible.
  instantly, it gets up and sprints after it. its so fast you can hardly see it leave... <br><br>
  you quickly look around to get your bearings. it seems youre in a hallway of some sort?
  you can make out a staircase at the end of the hallway, but there are also a few
  doors lining the walls as well. <br><br> if the freaky zombie dog is <em>that</em> fast, you
  probably dont have much time to make your next move.
  what now??</p>
