  <h1>main hallway</h1>
  <img src="images/hallway.png" alt="a hallway with multiple doors on either side" class="splash">
  <p>thats probably a good idea. why did you even consider breaking through the
  window?? intrusive thoughts are weird... <br><br>you softly knock on the large
  wooden doors of the house looming above you. no response. after knocking once more,
  you gently turn the handle and pull the door open. whoever lives here has a terrible
  sense of security. <br><br>the door is unsurprisingly heavy, and it takes quite a bit of
  force to swing open. as you cautiously take a few steps into the house, the door
  slowly shuts itself behind you. no going back now. unless, of course, you crash through
   the window to get back out. but you can think about that later. <br><br>your eyes
  scan and scrutinize the room in front of you. its a large, empty hallway with doors on
  either side, but it looks like the hallway extends pretty far ahead, too. the windows light up
  as thunder claps outside, shaking the walls. you should probably look for some help, or
  a safe place to stay until the storm subsides...</p>
