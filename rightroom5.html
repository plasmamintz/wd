  <h1>right room</h1>
  <img src="images/rightroomsaki.png" alt="a dark room... with a beautiful goddess standing in the middle of it" class="splash">
  <p>you should head ba- <br><br>whats this???<br><br>to your utmost surprise, a lone zombie stands
  in the middle of the previously empty room. she looks disheveled, confused, and lost. her
  yellow hair flows messily into a long ponytail suspended behind her head, and she looks at you
  with a menacing glare. somehow, though, you can feel that her intentions aren't hostile. <br><br>
  the most important thing you notice is that she is visibly confused, and that means she's conscious.
  <br><br>"what are you looking at," she mumbles. "you wanna die??" <br><br>
  you explain to her that you accidentally stumbled into this weird freaky house, and that you're
  trying to escape. to your surpise, she announces that shes trying to escape too, and a grin stretches across her face.
  <br><br> after she introduces herself as saki nikaido,the two of you agree to escape together, and book it for the only window in the room, which happens to be pried wide open
  (so <em>that</em> explains why it was so cold in there...)</p>
