  <p>you continue towards the end of the hallway and climb up the spiral staircase. <br><br>
  after a few moments, you find yourself in a large room resembling a bedroom. surprisingly,
  the lights are on, and you feel incredibly safe. you find a cozy couch with a fluffy white pillow
  laying loosely on top of it. youre not sure why, but the warmth of the lights, the
  spaciousness of the area, and the overall comfyness of this room makes you feel at ease.
  you look at the couch once more. this is what you wanted. rest. it beckons you to sleep...</p>
