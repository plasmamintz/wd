  <p>suddenly, you emerge from the shroud and to your disbelief, you find yourself
    in an entirely different setting. the convenience store is gone, the rainy street is gone,
    the creepy house is gone. in its place stands medieval buildings, shops, and houses, with brick roads
    and flamboyant street vendors. anthropomorphic bipedal creatures stride alongside anciently dressed
    humans. <br><br>as the sun's rays bathe you in warmth and light, you start to realize
    that somehow, you've been transported to an entirely different world. <br><br>
    and so your life begins anew.</p>
