  <h1>guilty ending (3/8)</h1>

  <p>wow. <br><br>as much as i hate to say it, two wrongs make a right?? i guess??
  somehow, after crashing through the same broken window twice, you end up on the outside of the
  house again. you book it for the road and start sprinting home in the rain while reflecting on
  your actions. <br><br>you broke a window. twice. and then you killed someone who was already dead.
  they died twice because of you. if anyone were to know about that, youd probably have like,
  two life sentences on your head. and now you have to live the rest of your life carrying
  that guilt. sucks to be you.</p>
