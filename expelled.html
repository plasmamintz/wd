  <h1>expelled ending (4/8)</h1>
  <img src="images/expelled.png" alt="" class="splash">
  <p>you pick a door and enter the room. <br><br>to your surprise, a young man
  with black shades is standing in the middle of the room, holding the zombie
  dog in his arms. how did that dog get in here... <br><br> without introducing himself
  or saying anything at all, he begins to wrap your cuts in bandages without your permission.
  youre shocked, but you dont say a word. when he finishes, he stands up, and apologizes for any
  troubles this house might have caused you. you silently nod... <br><br>
  he then explains that you're trespassing, and technically, he could press charges. <br><br>
  you freeze up. you dont have enough money to fight a lawsuit... <br><br>
  however, he goes on further to say that he wont do anything...as long as you stay quiet about
  the inhabitants of the house. you look at the zombie dog momentarily. it stares back with
  beady, lifeless eyes. <br><br> you then tell the man that you understand, and agree to secrecy.
  <br><br>and so, he leads you to the front door (where you were <em>supposed</em> to enter) and sends you
  off with an umbrella and a raincoat. you thank him, and begin your walk home. <br><br>
  did you really just get expelled from a haunted house for causing too much trouble?? how embarassing...</p>
