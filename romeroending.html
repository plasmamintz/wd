  <h1>??? ending (9/8)</h1>
  <img src="images/romeroplush.jpg" alt="zombie dog plushie" class="splash">
  <p>you look at the zombie dog for a moment more, and you remember some fried
  squid you left in your pocket earlier. you cant seem to remember how or why
  you have calamari in your pocket though... <br><br>
  you grab the fried squid and offer it to the dog. it happily eats it up, tearing it apart with its teeth.
  after a moment, the dog finishes the snack, and looks very content with itself. <br><br>
  theres a pause. <br><br>
  and then the dog suddenly goes stiff, and falls on its back. you press on it with a finger.
  <br><br>it seems to have turned into a marketable plushie. <br><br>
  huh. strange.</p>
