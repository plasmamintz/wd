  <h1>cup noodles ending (5/8)</h1>
  <img src="images/cupnoodle.png" alt="some cups of noodles on a shelf" class="splash">
  <p>you get up and take a look around the store. they've got a rather enticing
    supply of goods, honestly. cream sodas, neopolitan ice cream, bagged chips.
    they even have a slushee machine! you step into the snack aisle and find
    their beautiful stash of cup noodles. so many flavors... cup noodles sound
    really good right now. <br><br>
    while entranced by the noodles, you hear your name shouted from the end of the aisle.
    you turn your head to look, and to your surprise, your mother is standing there, crying
    tears of relief! you jump into her arms, explaining how you got lost while exploring a creepy neighborhood,
    and that you probably avoided a haunted house full of zombies. she kisses you on the
    forehead, smiling. the both of you leave the store, relieved, happy, and safe. <br><br>
    but of course, not before she buys you a cup of noodles for the road.</p>
