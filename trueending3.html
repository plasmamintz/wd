  <h1>true ending (1/8)</h1>
  <img src="images/trueending.png" alt="seven zombie idols posing" class="splash">
  <p>this is all so sudden for you... <br><br>gradually you begin to accept
  the fact that you died 10 years ago from a fatal accident with a truck, and this really is
  your second shot at life. you always did want to become an idol... <br><br>
  over the course of what could easily be translated into twelve episodes of an animated
  television show, you and your zombie friends perform around the local province, garnering
  support and love from fans all over the region. the seven of you grow inseperable like family,
  and the happiness you give to one another becomes eternal. <br><br>
  as your unlikely group rises to the top, you start to reflect on that rainy night all those
  months ago... <br><br> you're glad you took this path. this is finally a place to succeed,
  to find joy, and to belong. all alongside six other zombies pretending to be idols. <br><br>
  thats your saga!</p>
