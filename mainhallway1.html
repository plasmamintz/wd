  <p>you reenter the main hallway.<br><br>your eyes
  scan and scrutinize the room in front of you. its a large, empty hallway with doors on
  either side, but it looks like the hallway extends pretty far ahead, too. the windows light up
  as thunder claps outside, shaking the walls. you should probably look for some help, or
  a safe place to stay until the storm subsides...</p>
