  <p>you reach the facade of the big dark freaky house and suddenly the clouds
    open up, unleashing their cold watery fury upon you. to be totally honest,
    you weren't <em>actually</em> going to enter the house. you were planning
    on just walking up to it and then walking away with nothing but bragging
    rights. but now that youre sopping wet, youll probably catch a cold and
    possibly die due to your horrible immune system if you stand out in the
    rain any longer. how pathetic! what a dilemma. what will you do about your
    predicament?</p> <br>
