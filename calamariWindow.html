  <p>...why?? why would you do that? there was no reason for you to do that... <br><br>
  as you inspect your body, you note the many cuts and scratches you gained from smashing through
  a window. not to mention the loud sound that you made from performing such a stunt. thats
  what you get for being wreckless... <br><br>you take a cursory glance around the room.
  besides the shattered window and the glass shards on the floor, everything seems pretty
  normal, although this room has quite an eerie feel to it... <br><br>you begin to anticipate your
  next move.</p>
