  <p>as you sit and wait on the bench for help, you start shivering again.
    the air conditioning in this store is eating you alive. soaking clothes
    paired with convenience store air conditioning is a nightmare. your vision begins to blur once again.
    this is getting a little annoying yknow? its not a pleasant experience being totally blind.
    it actually kinda hurts. this sucks. is it because youre cold? or is it just
    god screwing with your eyeballs? whats happening???</p> <br>
