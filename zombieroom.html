  <p>the morning light pours in through the windows and wakes you gently, like
  a mother to her baby. <br><br>
  then suddenly, and not so mother-to-baby-like, you hear a startling scream from elsewhere in the room.
  you shoot up to your feet and frantically look for the cry of fear, adrenaline pumping through your veins. <br><br>
  its only then that you notice - zombies! there are zombies all across your room, and theyre... <br><br>
  theyre shaking in fear? why are <em>they</em> scared? theyre zombies! <em>you</em> should be the scared one! <br><br>
  quickly!! react! scream and try to fight one of them, or something!</p>
