  <p>you decide to investigate the windows. <br><br> you begin to scan up and down the windows
  on the wall. theyre fairly tall, towering a few meters over you. <br><br>
  on one particular window sill, you find a men's dressy vest, folded nicely, with some
  fried squid tucked in the pocket. <br><br> wait, what? <br><br> you do a double take, and
  sure enough, theres a small wad of calamari tucked away in the pocket of the vest. totally stumped,
  you stare at it for a few seconds. <em>why</em> is there open calamari in the pocket of a folded vest??
  <br><br>for some reason, your first instinct is to take it for yourself. <br><br>...should you take it?</p>
