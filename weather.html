  <p>the moment you make up your decision to leave the calamari alone, the rain silences
  and the clouds begin to clear. how is that possible??? that calamari must have been cursed...
  <br><br>you open the window in front of you and climb out of the creepy old house. patting the
  dust off of you, you make your way back towards the road. the sun shines warmth upon you,
  comfortably toasting your skin and easing your senses. looks like that calamari changes
  the time of day, too. <br><br>as you jog back down the street to leave, you take one
  last look at the looming house, and silently promise yourself to never go near it again.</p>
