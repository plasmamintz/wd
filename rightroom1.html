  <p>you decide to enter a room on the right side of the hallway. upon opening
  the door, a chilly breeze crashes against your body.<br><br>
  its cold. and dark. you can hardly make out any details about this room. its eerily quiet despite
  the sound of the cold air brushing past your ears... <br><br>its too dark to see anything in here...
  besides, its freezing. thats not good for your soaking clothes and skin. you decide that this room is probably empty,
  and won't aid you in your search for help or shelter. <br><br>you should head back...</p>
