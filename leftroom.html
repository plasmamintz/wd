  <p>you decide to enter a room on the left side of the hallway. <br><br>
  this room is large and spacious. as lightning strikes and sets the sky ablaze, light
  pours in through the numerous windows lining the wall, but only for a moment. <br><br>
  there seems to be plenty to look at in this room, although the surprisingly warm atmosphere
  is throwing you off. taking a look around might prove beneficial, but you can't shake the
  feeling that theres something off about this room...</p>
