  <h1>koutarou ending (7/8)</h1>
  <img src="images/koutarou.png" alt="a man" class="splash">
  <p>you open the door to find yourself on the house's balcony. standing alone
  at the end of it is a young man with brown hair and black sunglasses. startlingly handsome. <br><br>
  you slowly make your way up beside him on the balcony edge. he is totally unphased by your presence...
  <br><br>he turns to you and introduces himself as koutarou tatsumi. you introduce yourself
  as well, and after a brief moment of silence, he invites you to live in this house with him
  out of the blue. you're taken aback at first, but then you look at him again, and absorb his
  aura. he smells like he just got out of a clawfoot bathtub... <br><br>
  on a whim, you instantly accept his offer. you're not sure why you did it, but you did,
  and so begins your mysterious future with koutarou tatsumi.</p>
