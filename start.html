  <p>its a dark, cloudy night. you stand alone on a quiet road with only a few
  streetlamps illuminating your way. the wind howls as it tears through the grass on either side of the street, and the chill gives you goosebumps. youre kinda scared. <br><br>
  what?? no youre not. youre not scared what are you some kind of wimp?
  get over it. things are dark all the time. in fact, theres a creepy house
  at the end of the street and youre gonna go inside it just do prove to
  yourself that you arent a wimp.</p>
