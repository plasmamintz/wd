  <img src="images/sakisakuramarriage.jpg" alt="an image of you, happily married to saki nikaido" class="splash">
  <p>after running away together, you and saki decide to live off the earth for a while due to your combined
  incredible lack of wealth. surprisingly, though, this lifestyle catapults your wellbeing, and
  saki's health skyrockets so much that her skin returns to its natural pigment, and she looks alive as ever.
  <br><br>after only one short year of warm experiences and fun times together, you and saki realize the
  unbreakable bond of love you share with each other, and you both find your true source of happiness
  within each other. your purpose, your soul, your everything, happily shared in love. <br><br>
  two years after that fateful night in the mansion, you and saki hold the wedding of a lifetime,
  and you both live the rest of your lives married to the girl of your dreams.</p>
