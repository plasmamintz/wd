  <p>you head back down the staircase. <br><br>
  why did you do that? you were so exhausted... and that couch looked so comfortable... regrettable.
  you head back down the hallway again, back to the front door, before you realize you dont really
  know where youre trying to go. lost, and utterly hopeless, you try a random door and enter a room.</p>
