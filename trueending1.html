  <h1>good morning?</h1>
  <img src="images/sakuragm.png" alt="you, screaming goodmorning" class="splash">
  <p>the incomprehensibility of the situation puts your mind in a blur. "what
  do i do??<em>what do i do?!?!</em> ", you think to yourself. <br><br>
  suddenly, on an absolute whim of a decision, you do the only thing that could
  come to your mind. at the top of your lungs, as loud as possible, you scream, <br><br>
  <em>good morning.</em> <br><br>the zombies look at you with mixed expressions,
  mainly confusion. its only then that a young man with brown hair and black
  shades enters the room.</p>
