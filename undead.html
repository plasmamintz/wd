  <h1>you died?</h1>
  <img src="images/zombieattack.png" alt="a group of zombies coming towards you" class="splash">
  <p>as you start to scrutinize the center of the open area, you realize that without the light
  of the storm, this room is rather dark. you squint, straining to see anything that might
  hint at whats in this room. <br> <br> and then lighting strikes. <em>kaboom.</em><br><br>
  revealed to you is a group of zombies, marching towards you! shocked by the sudden realization
  of your situation, you become paralyzed, unable to move. you watch in horror and fright
  as they inch closer, until finally, one lashes forwards, biting you firmly on your forearm.
  <br><br> this really isnt how you imagined your first encounter with cute zombie girls to go. <br><br>
  your skin begins to turn from its lively, warm pigment into a pale, rotten flesh, and your mind
  turns to static. devoid of thought, you join the zombies' march, having turned to one of them as well.
  <br><br>although, is this really a death? they call it the "undead" for a reason, right? <br><br>
  next time, maybe listen to your instincts.</p>
